# Design and layout.

Divergence 2 will carry over many of the features from the first. The research system, some of the difficulty and custom ore generation is all there.

### Starting
You start out in the astroid dimension in a escape pod, You must make the small journey to find the alien ship close by. This will be the hub much like the temple from the first. Where you return to to gain knowledge after you or your team complete the task within the quest system.
