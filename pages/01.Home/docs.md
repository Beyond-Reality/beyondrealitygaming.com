## Welcome to our wiki, Documentation will only be worked on for our 1.11.2 + modpacks.

##### If you would like to contribute please visit, https://github.com/Beyond-Reality/beyondrealitygaming.com/tree/master/pages/02.Mod-Pack's

The formatting is pretty straight forward to make a new page. Every page needs a folder, which adds the slug and adds it to the side menu of the main page. Every folder needs a markdown file labled docs.md inside of it. Which will contain all the information on the topic. At the top of each docs.md you need to add some YMAL matter to make it all function. 
You can copy and paste this for the most part
