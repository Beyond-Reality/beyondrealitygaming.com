### Find out all about Gravity

* Learn about **Gravity** by throwing out an anvil [Learn Gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity) site.
* get **feathers**, **anvils**, as well as other Gravity testing **devices** from [ebay](http://ebay.com/) page.
* Check out our [Gravity Experiments Blog](http://buggyandbuddy.com/gravity/) to find out the latest downfalls on in the Gravity-well we are stuck-in.

### Do not edit this Page

You have ben warned, gravity is a serious physical property. You were installed into a **Gravity Well**. You will not escape that easilly.

### Create a New Gravity

Creating a new gravity is quite simple. Just change one single cosmological constant:

1. Either speed of light: C
2. Either gravity itself: G

! NOTE: The page will automatically destroy itself once you have finished reading.

! ERRATA: Due to a cosmological failure, the autodestruction process stopped.
